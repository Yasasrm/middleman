# About The Project

The API supports basic CRUD operations with locally created JSON files. Hobbyists who are interested in IOT projects can use this API. The goal of this project is to provide a way to communicate your Android or iOS app with your Arduino/ESP32/ Raspberry-pi (etc.) based project. Depending on your needs, you may host this locally on your computer or in the cloud (Vercel, Firebase, AWS, render, etc.).
